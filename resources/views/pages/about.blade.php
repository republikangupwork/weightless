			            	<ul>
			            		<li>Preferably but not necessarily fill the application form in your account.</li>
			            		<li>Decide what principle of nutrition you will adhere to for the entire period of weight loss and prepare for it. Perhaps to do replacement principles nutrition, but if you constantly chase to change principle nutrition #2 on other, then outcome will not very a good,so as this principle is the most highly effective but in is case if his to adhere to not less 1.5-2 month.</li>
			            		<li>Carefully study the basic rules of nutrition.</li>
			            		<li>Start your weight loss course with a fasting day. To do this, watch the video fasting day and eat all day only one product which you have chosen in advance (kefir / cottage cheese/apples)
 								If you have the opportunity to be active,watch the video energy,and proceed immediately to action. Dance,run on the treadmill, swim,ride a bike or just do some cleaning. If you plan to lie on the couch all day or sit at the office Desk, you do not need to spend time watching this video. In this situation, it will not help to go to the increased consumption of calories in passive mode as you would like it, despite the fact that you will feel more active and easy. 
 								If you plan to go to the gym, then before going out watching video energy will be a great option to increase all your records several times.</li>
			            		<li>The next day, watch a video for hormone level correction or a video for psychomotor correction. You can watch these videos in one day, but it is better to alternate and watch every other day. Effect from viewing have all persists differently (1-2 days) so better look on the morning or a day to,and so same not late on the evening, but not before nightmare, so as effect can be underestimated. 
								The body will get used to the new diet over time and you will not need to watch different videos every day, only once a week or once in two weeks to consolidate the effect, then supporting viewing once a month.</li>
			            		<li>You can ask questions, we will be happy to answer them, but given the difference in time of urgent response, we can not do, be patient, or check the section of frequent questions and answers.</li>
			            		<li>You can give watch video for spouse or very close relative who lives with you.</li>
			            		<li>It is forbidden to give to view the video to persons who do not have a relationship to you. Every video is the inscription "Respect the laws of the universe" this warning Is given for the benefit of you! It is quite difficult to explain the mechanism of energy interaction, the whole process of energy exchange, so if you do not want to harm yourself or the person who is not your relationship then avoid the transmission of video for viewing. 
								Part of your money goes to support specific Orthodox shrines(monasteries, churches) and other charity that helps you and me to develop, achieve success, so please be more aware of your actions, be honest and pure in soul!!!</li>
